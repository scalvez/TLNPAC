High energy cosmic particles reaching earth induce hadronic showers in the upper atmosphere which can lead to pions and kaons creation.
Those pions and kaons will mainly decay into muons according to $\pi^\pm\rightarrow\mu^\pm  \nu_\mu$ and  $K^\pm\rightarrow\mu^\pm  \nu_\mu$ \cite{PDG}.
Muons can then decay into electron with the process $\mu^\pm\rightarrow e^\pm \nu_e \nu_\mu$.
Because of special relativity, high energy muons can travel to the ground before decaying so the caracteristic time of this process can be measured at sea level.
Muons reaching the ground have a mean  energy of  $6$~GeV \cite{}.

The purpose of this experiment is to stop those muons  and look for this decay with the electron depositing energy in the detector.
